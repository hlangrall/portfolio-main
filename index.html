            Learning ever more about HTML and how to be terrifyingly specific and how to connect that to the CSS so that there is such clear and definite instructions for how everything is supposed to look as well as how to work together.</p>

            Focusing much more on CSS and how to make such dramatic changes to the content and seeing how you can mold it all to exactly the format you are looking for.</p>

          <p class="half-width">I signed up for Skillcrush after finding them during a job search. I had never considered a job in tech, but they made it sound like fun! I have enjoyed every step of the way so far as it is hugely satisfying to immediately put to use the skills I am learning. It is also really nice to use my brain to problem-solve and adjust these lines of code to perfection. Bringing content and concept to life using HTML and CSS is utterly delightful! And knowing that this world of tech is constantly advancing and will require continuing my education in such is something I very much look forward to.
